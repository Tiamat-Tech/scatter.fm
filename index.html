      Your last.fm account has a ton of data about your listening history, but
      last.fm only shows you condensed 'top 10' type statistics. Scatter.fm shows
      you all of your scrobbles, together on one screen.</p>
    <p>
      Visualise this scrobbling history, and see the changes over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scatter.fm displays every one of your scrobbles on one screen, to give a
      rich, dense visualisation of your listening data.
